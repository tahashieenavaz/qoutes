# Why this repo was created ?
When you are developing your self you have to read texts written by giants like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Mark Douglas, Yuval Noah Harari and many many more.
That being said you face a whole bunch of quotes from these master minds, you can pass on, or **write them out**.
I always choose former.
I will share them all here and you can find them in a better format on my landing page.

I would love to add your quotes to my banks.

> Time is a drug. Too much of it kills you.
> (Terry Pratchett)

> Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.
> (Bill Gates)

> A lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they've got terrible temperaments.
> (Charlie Munger)


# Why you update it often ?
**Repetition** is a key **learning** aid because it helps transition a skill from the conscious to the subconscious.
Updating this repository coerces me to open my old notebooks and actually review these great insights and of course compound my knowledge.
But as an ENTP, I love sharing.
